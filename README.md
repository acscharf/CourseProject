# English and Japanese Course Reflection Analysis and Prediction

## What is this project?

After learners complete an online business course, they are prompted to enter a "reflection" on how they can apply the knowledge from the course to their job or daily life. These reflections are shared with other learners so they can deepen their understanding, learning how others applied their learning.

This project aims to:
1.) to analyze "useful" and "not useful" reflections, finding syntatic elements that make up each
2.) gather user input for a user reflection and predict whether that reflection is "useful" or "not useful"
