,"In our daily life, we often encounter scenarios where we need to solve a problem. Though, in an office setting, solving a problem with a definite and doable solution is expected. Often times, to immediately solve a problem, we skip the process of WHAT, WHERE, WHY, and HOW. Also, we tend to conclude a solution which is based solely from the data we've heard or seen at hand. Thus, our recommended solution is not often accepted to be the best option. With this, we need to keep in mind the process and carefully study the course of action that will solve the problem. This learning would most likely help me especially when dealing with problems in my work place."

,"Oragnizational behaviour is very important and essential in either governmental and private organizations to interact the tasks. Even in the family, this must be applied. Team members and their leader are interdependant in each and every team. Leader cannot stand himself and subordinate cannot work without leader's guidance and management. So, we need to build mutual confidence and respect at first. Secondly, we need to build friendship in my personal opinion. One cannot administer the people without mutual understanding and friendship all the time. In addition, you need to give personal comfort, praise and incentives. 

I don't have any theoretical knowledge of management and leadership before. In the past, I happened to easily assess my team members just by sight and divide the work ad hoc, at the beginning. And I faced some conflict and difficulties because of my nascent experience. According to my personal experience, Chief of the team or Manager should study personality and competence of each of his team member first by closely looking at their action and talking with them. Then, they should decide who could be trusted in and empowered as appropriate. We should suspend the empowerment for those who are yet to be eligible and train and guide them gradually by using the theories in this course depending on the situation. Those theories can also be used, I believe, to raise up your offsprings or your junior relatives in the family."

,"some staff employed at the governmental agency at my work place are less proficient and self-motivated, but some are skillful and motivated, so mixed approach based on management and leadership are likely to work to a certain extent. For example, those who are competent and highly motivated can work as a coach or trainer to those who show less proficiency and willingness. they are supposed to take a role of resource supporter while directing toward organizational short-term visions. However, looking at the long-term vision is highly uncertain, employee routinely just do their duties without realizing the seeming point of the goals. Thus, I think proposing a fundamental driving change which allow all employees to envision their workplace's visions, not only a short-term goal, but also a sense of long-term vision, which should be widely realized within the workplace. staff should be allowed to express their creativity and innovation and these ideas then should be wisely responded and highly appreciated to encourage them to go further thru a medium of the visions set. Motivation should also be a plus to keep them remain motivated in alignment with the set direction. "

Leading = long term, vision, strategy, risk, change, uncertainty, give direction, ask big/ wide questions, align staff to the vision, raise expectations, create condusive environment, grow people to grow the business. Long term results more important.
Outcome = learning 
1) tell them where to go, 2) Motivate them, 3) Develop them

Short term results more important.
Outcome = result driven
"
,"This course has expressed clearly the differences between leadership and management. Leadership involves driving change through creation and innovation by establishing visions, while management focuses on operating an organization. Managers must consist of both leadership and management, and they need to know right time and situation to use which one. We use different styles of management according to types of employees and situations we meet. We use management approach (coaching and directing) when our employees has lower proficient, and we use leadership approach (supporting and delegating) for employees who are more proficiency. To conclude, managers should know their employees firmly."
,"The director of a new company wants to expand customers number. But the director has not enough time to do marketing tasks and management of company team simultaneously. So, the director chooses a motivated employee and empowers the management tasks to the employee. "

Another thing is to access the ability of the employee. Finally, to make them understand the vision of the organization so that they don't think the manager is giving his work to them."
,"The course gave me an idea on how, as a subordinate, I could be empowered for my own career growth and, as a project leader, I could help my colleagues in managing their own potentials as key assets of my organization"
,This course gives a good idea on how I can further motivate my employees and on how to properly delegate tasks for more successful outcomes.

I also learned that I could entrust my staff with works that can be slightly beyond their current capability. In this manner, I could effectively and efficiently manage all the tasks assigned to me by my supervisor and lead my team to the achievement of our goal."
,"I have learned that empowerment is one of a management tool that would motivate the subordinates to work autonomously to help achieve the goals of the organization. I sometimes tend to not delegate the tasks because I am perfectionist and I want to be in a command-control situation. However, in this course, the discussion on the importance of delegation, once again reminded me that as a leader, I should learn to delegate effectively because this is one way of empowering a subordinate. I should take note the three points to remember in empowerment: 1) not every task is suited for empowerment; 2) consider employee's authority in a given task; and 3) assess the risks of empowerment and plan accordingly.

,"The course on organizational behavior provide both theories and explanations of organizational behavior, the different between leadership and management, and approaches of empowering and motivating. The course leads me to understand phenomena of interaction in an organization, depending on individual and group. Modern managers must know leadership styles to be success in managing individual and groups. By doing so, they need to realize that Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, theory X and theory Y, motivation-hygiene theory are used for understanding source of motivation (early theories), while goal setting theory and expectancy theory are more practical (contemporary theories). Goal setting theory relates to setting clear and achievable goals and giving feedback. Expectancy theory relates to building trust and understanding employees as individuals. Besides knowing the nature of the motivation source and practical theories, they need to manage group by making clear message sending and receiving and avoiding the group conflicts. All of these are steps of interaction in an organization that managers must know in order to use appropriate leadership styles for real situations. However, in my opinion, these theories can only ensure short term or medium term process, since every things depend on individuals. Sometimes, a manager provide right incentives to motivate their employees but the staffs cannot work in that organization for long term. One important question for asking staffs is that why you want to work for this organization. The response can help us to evaluate the staffs will make good performance in organization or not."
,"It would be very useful for me to have understood the difference between leadership and management. Now, I am responsible for reorganizing my company as a board director. According to the situation,  departments, or person, I could consider which way is better to apply. "
